On Tuesday evening, November 12th, the Planning Commission and City
Council held a joint meeting on the commercial development, with Doug
White, the developer, and Cory Shupe, with Blu Line Designs.

<!-- PELICAN_END_SUMMARY -->

## Blu Line Designs

Cory Shupe gave a presentation on the proposed development, discussing
the master site plan that includes a senior living facility (55+), a
movie theater, restaurants, and retail spaces. First, he provided an
overview of the senior living facility, showing the location and
placement of the building, as well as the 1/2-mile exercise path
surrounding the site. Next he showed some of the computerized
renderings that show the facility in relation to several views in the
city. These are all slides shown previously and discussed in my
[previous blog
entry](http://cedarhillsblog.org/commercial-development/).

Mr. Shupe then spent some time discussing the height of the
building. He showed this new slide comparing the height of the
facility to other buildings in Cedar Hills:

I questioned Mr. White on this picture, because it the relative height
of a building can be fudged in a photo by zooming in or out. He did
not have exact heights of the buildings he was showing, but was
estimating comparative height by knowing the typical height of a
residential floor vs a commercial floor, which is somewhat larger. We
should get some accurate measurements of surrounding buildings so we
have a better idea of the height of the senior living facility
relative to its surroundings.

Mr. Shupe also discussed this slide, which was shown in previous
meetings:

This shows that the closest point of the facility to residential lots
is 98 feet. The recommended maximum height of a building is 30' with
30' of setback. An additional height bonus of 1' per additional 2' of
setback MAY be granted by the plannign commission, up to a maximum of
50'. From the drawing, the facility appears to fall within this limit
at four stories, due to the extra setback, but may be slightly over
the 50' limit at five stories.

Mr. Shupe also showed some slides of a commercial project in Chandler,
Arizona. This area is similar in size to the development he is
planning, and shows some of the character he is trying to bring to our
commercial area.

## Questions

Following this presentation, some members of the planning commission
and city council asked questions of the developers. Mr. Driggs wanted
to know whether we could trust the developer to follow through on his
commercial plans for the area. Mr. White stated that they will own the
facility and some surrounding retail area. They have an incentive to
make the area commercially attractive to the residents. In particular,
they want to be able to get retail toward the back of the area, and
not just a strip along the street. That is why he is proposing a main
street type development.

Ms. Martinez wanted to know about the ages of residents in a 55+
building. Mr. White stated that no children are allowed, by law, and
this was also stated to us on our tour by the property manager of
Rosegate. The 80/20 rule does apply, so those younger than 55+ can
live there, but only with others that are 55+ in the same
space. Ms. Martinez also wanted to know if these units would be for
sale or lease, and Mr. White stated that these would be for lease.

## Chandler Goodwin

Mr. Goodwin, the assistant city manager and city planner, gave a
presentation on the city's [Design
Guidelines](http://www.cedarhills.org/sites/default/files/commercial-development-guidelines.pdf). Some
of this is a repeat from my [earlier blog
post](http://cedarhillsblog.org/city-ordinances-and-design-guidelines/)
on city code and the design guidelines.

This is an important statement from the guidelines:

> While the intent of this Plan is to provide standards for approval,
> it is not intended to be so rigid as to deny all flexibility and
> latitude that may be necessary for individual users within the Plan
> area.

This demonstrates that these are not rules, but guidelines for the
planning commission and city council as they make decisions on whether
to approve a development. There are requirements in city code on
noise, light, pollution, etc. The guidelines do emphasize viable mixed
use and a walkable zone.

The commercial zone is divided into three sub-districts. The Smart
property is in the Office/Retail sub-district. There is discussion of
the structure height in this section.

> One to three story buildings are permitted although two-story
> buildings are encouraged in order to more fully convey the desired
> architectural theme. Buildings within the Office/Retail Development
> may be erected to a maximum height of thirty (30) feet. An
> additional height bonus of one (1) foot per additional two (2) foot
> increase from the required setback may be granted, up to a maximum
> height of fifty (50) feet occupied space, with unoccupied space
> approved by the City Council with a recommendation from the Planning
> Commission. The Planning Commission may increase the required
> setback or require additional architectural elements for buildings
> taller than thirty-five (35) feet, if after due consideration, feel
> it necessary to mitigate any negative impacts that the proposed
> development may have on the residential development. Height is
> measured from average, finished grade to the top of cornice or
> parapet for flat roofs, and the midpoint of rake for sloped roofs.

There are different definitions of height, which is confusing.

> The building size shall be reviewed by the City Council and
> potentially approved based on such items as building placement,
> aesthetics, noise control, lighting design, traffic control, etc. to
> give the feel consistent with the overall commercial development, as
> well as the community as a whole.

The facades:

> Long and monotonous walls and roof planes are not permitted. The
> apparent mass of large buildings shall be minimized by manipulating
> the building form by using offsets and recesses and variations in
> height. Smaller, individual buildings that tend to break up parking
> areas and create visual interest are encouraged.

From Section 4:

> Exterior construction is normally of brick in traditional colors
> like red and brown, and makes use of substantial exterior
> moldings. Wrought iron or copper accents are also used. It is
> expected that this theme will create intimacy and interest by
> limiting the use of those architectural elements that only cater to
> the widespread domination of the automobile. That is to say,
> architectural designs should be kept in such a scale so as to
> maintain a human, rather than automobile, orientation. The inclusion
> of street level windows, wide walks and appropriate signage are a
> few of the elements that must be considered in maintaining
> consistency with this theme. The appropriate selection of materials
> and colors are also essential in maintaining consistency with this
> theme and in meeting the goals of this document. Examples of several
> types of architecture that may be appropriate as part of this
> development can be found within this document.

Mr. Zappala asked whether this development was considered assisted
living. The property manager at Rosegate indicated it is not, and
Scott Jackman concurred. This means it falls under a residential,
attached unit, and the guidelines says the residential portion of the
building should be ancillary to the retail purpose of the building,
and that the residential portion should be at most 50%.

Mr. Goodwin discussed that the building has community gathering points
and activities every night, so it is similar in nature to an assisted
living facility, except for having nursing staff on duty. The planning
commission and city council have the latitude in the guidelines to
decide how to apply these definitions. Mr. Jackman repeated that
everything is conditional, so we have to approve everything.

## Feedback

The planning commission and city council then provided some feedback
to the developer.

* Mr. Jackman stated a concern about 300 units, which is a lot. That
  consumes a lot of commercial space. Mr. Jackman also stated a
  concern about completion. We may grant residential density in hope
  of commercial return, but this is a risk. Finally, Mr. Jackman
  stated that the purpose of the design guidelines is for a blended
  feel across the site. The proposed commercial developments fit that
  well. However, the theater sticks out. He is not sure how it all
  blends with the residential area.

* Ms. Rees asked Mr. White about bringing the height down to two or
  three stories. Mr. White stated they already dropped to four stories
  on the perimeter from five stories. He stated he needs a certain
  number count to maintain a five star facility, with the amenities
  that will be in it.

* Mr. Zappala stated a concern about parking, and ensuring enough
  spaces, incuding for visitors. He also stated that a theater could
  be a very good thing for the retail area, because it allows us to
  bring in higher-scale sit-down restaurants and retail areas, as
  opposed to a strip of fast food restaurants on 4800 W.

* Ms. Martinez asked about sinking the first story of the building
  into a basement, but the developer stated that wouldn't work very
  well for residences. He added that some of the amenities like a
  theater could be on a basement floor. However, he generally prefers
  put a special feature, such as a library, theater, or craft room, on
  each floor.

* Mayor Gygi stated he has talked to neighbors, and they are mostly
  concerned about size. They can accept the idea of a three-story
  building with a basement that has amenities, and fewer units such as
  150 to 200 units.

* Mr. Dodge and Mr. Driggs suggested lowering the height and removing
  the retail. Mr. White stated that, economically, he could push
  building down to four stories and drop the number of units to
  275-300. He is reluctant to go under 300 to maintain a 5-star
  building.

* Mr. Dodge stated that most concerns have been addressed except
  building height. He personally likes the idea of a senior center,
  but doesn't like the idea of a five-story building. He thinks the
  building can be redesigned to meet 5-star criteria with three
  stories on the sides and four stories in the middle. Perhaps some
  longer wings will be needed. He is anxious to get started.

* Mr. Johnson, our city attorney, intervened here to state that we
  need to have an applicaiton before the commission and council before
  anything can be approved. Anything we said to the developer tonight
  is advice and feedback from residents, but is not binding.

* Mr. Zappala asked about the difference between a three-star and a
  five-star facility. Mr. White stated a three-star building has no
  grand entrance, there is little retail, the types of hallways and
  unit configurations are different, and the amenities are a step
  below what a five-star building will offer. The details will be
  submitted with the application, with architectural renderings.

* Mr. Weber suggested closing the ends of the units to enclose
  courtyards and add more units that way. Mr. White said that this
  makes the residents feel confined and prefers the open
  look. Mr. Weber suggested perhaps arches to provide the open feel.

* Mr. Jeff Dodge stated his primary concern is homes to the south and
  the height of the facility.

* Mr. Augustus stated that we have a tradeoff between a taller
  building with more room for commercial on the rest of the property,
  versus a shorter building that is spread out and takes up some of
  the commercial area. We want to maximize the use of the commercial
  area. He would like to see a three plus four story building, and how
  it can be configured to get the number of units they need.

* Mr. Steele stated we need to be sure not to close in courtyards and
  add mass to the building. He wants to emphasize commercial
  development.

* Mr. Zappala stated that later we will need to be careful with
  ensuring traffic does not cause significant impacts on 9900 North
  when exiting the theater. This will need redesigning.

* Mr. Gygi closed with by saying we have only one chance to do this
  right. The residents have shared concerns, and we appreciate the
  developer for listening. His concern about young families moving in,
  taxing ability of the school system, has been eased because no kids
  under 19 can be there. He said residents have concerns about
  traffic, but we will have increases in traffic no matter what due to
  commercial development. He appreciates what is being done by the
  developers to meet resident concerns.

## Closing Thoughts

From speaking with the developer afterwards, I think we were able to
strike a good balance of expressing resident concerns without being so
inflexible that the developer will abandon the project. I think there
is a good chance that he will submit a formal application and that the
proposed building will be reduced in scope, possibly to three stories
with four stories in the middle wings.

I would appreciate hearing your feedback on whether a mixed
three-and-four story building would work for you. In addition, how do
you feel about attracting sit-down restaurants and strong retail
chains with a theater, versus having fast food restaurants and strip
malls?
