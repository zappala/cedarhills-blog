On Tuesday, 18 August 2015, the planning commission will
hold a public hearing on a congregate care facility
proposed for the corner of Cedar Hills Drive and 4600 West.
This facility is called the Rosegate at Cedar Hills Development
and is a revision of a proposal that has been brought before the
planning commission several times.

<!-- PELICAN_END_SUMMARY -->

## Current Proposal

The current proposal is shown in the image below:

![site plan](/images/towne-center/2015/site-plan.png)

The large building in the center is the congregate care facility,
with three retail buildings of various sizes on the west end. Note
the new road that needs to be built, 4700 West, which is part of the
plan for the commercial area. This road is across from the main
driveway into WalMart on Cedar Hills Drive, and may eventually
extend throughout the commercial area.

The congregate care facility is proposed to be three stories high.  The
original proposal for this building was a smaller footprint, but four
stories tall on the sides and five stories in the middle. Because our
design guidelines state a preference of two stories, with a maximum of
three, the developer has lowered the height of the building. To
maintain his target of 300 units, he has also stretched the footprint
of the building to cover the entire portion of the Mixed-Use
Office/Retail sub-district that is available for this property. This
is the only remaining portion of our commercial zone that allows an
assisted living facility, which is why the building has an "L"
shape. The developer is clearly trying to maximize the size of the
building that could fit on the property.

Below are some renderings of the elevations for the proposed
building. This is from the east side, across from the Charleston,
showing the front entrance of the building:

This is from the same east side, but zoomed in to show some detail
of the front:

The following are the west, north, and south elevations:

This gives you a sense of the scale of the building.

## Public Hearing

I encourage residents to provide substantive feedback at the public
hearing.  The planning commission can't make a recommendation based on
"public clamor", in other words people who are just generally
dissatisfied with this building. Rather, both the planning commission
and the city council need to make decisions based on findings of fact.
For example, these may be based on how the building fits with our
general plan; the size, scale, or density of the building; the zoning
of the area; whether the building fits a definition of congregate care
and is similar to assisted living; the compatibility of the building
with the surrounding residential community; and other considerations
listed in our [general plan](http://www.cedarhills.org/general-plan), [city
code](http://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=577)
and [design
guidelines](http://www.cedarhills.org/sites/default/files/commercial-development-guidelines.pdf).
