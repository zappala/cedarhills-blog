On Wednesday, 1 July 2015, I attended a meeting arranged by
[Protect and Preserve American Fork
Canyon](http://americanforkcanyon.com/) at American Fork High
School. The purpose of the meeting was to inform residents about
recent developments in the canyon area, focusing primarily on the
Mountain Accord proposal to swap land owned by Snowbird in Salt Lake
County for land owned by the Forest Service in Utah County. Snowbird
for some time has wanted to expand their ski and resort operations.
There were several presentations and a question-and-answer session.

# Opening

The meeting opened with presentations by the Protect and Preserve
American Fork Canyon organization. These included a description
of how the group was created, following revelations of the proposed
Snowbird land swap, and a great video of the canyon area.

The land swap has been covered extensively in the Daily Herald:

Snowbird has wanted to expand into Utah County and American Fork Canyon for some time, dating back at least to 2011 ([Snowbird proposes tram in American Fork Canyon](http://www.heraldextra.com/business/local/snowbird-proposes-tram-in-american-fork-canyon/article_91d21cf0-1498-5680-95a8-8b57497149b4.html)).

We then heard the text of the [resolution passed by American Fork](http://afcity.org/DocumentCenter/Home/View/3467).

# MAG

We next heard a presentation from Sean Seager, Director, Metropolitan
Planning Organization, with [Mountainland Association of
Governments](Director, Metropolitan Planning Organization). MAG
provides regional transportation planning, meals-on-wheels, and
community development block grants.

Mr. Seager gave an overview of the timeline for both [Mountain
Accord](http://mountainaccord.com/) and [American Fork Canyon
Vision](http://afcvision.com/). AFC Vision received $100,000 in
funding from the state, which was directed to MAG through UDOT, to
manage the visioning project. The goal of this project is to develop a
plan for how the canyon should be used over the short term, medium
term, and long term (10 years), including transportation and
uses. Mountain Accord is a separate process that works on idealized
systems in the mountains for Salt Lake, Wasatch, and Summit Counties.
Mountain Accord has been working for quite some time on its plans,
whereas the AFC Vision group is relatively new.

The AFC Vision group released an RFP for a coordinator in July 2014
and then hired Logan Simpson for project planning ($80K) and Utah
State University for user surveys in the canyon ($58K). Intercept
surveys began this year, with an emphasis on collecting data
consistent with surveys done nationally on National Forest land and
with surveys collected by Mountain Accord. Realizing they were short
of money, AFC Vision solicited donations and Snowbird donated
$50K. Meanwhile, Mountain Accord began looking at Utah County land in
February or March of this year, and the proposed land trades became
public in March. The controversy started shortly thereafter, because a
group without Utah County representation was proposing to allow
Snowbird to expand its operations in Utah County in return for
watershed protections in Salt Lake County. In the last few weeks, AFC
Vision refunded its donation to Snowbird, due to pressure that they
were facing from the public regarding the land swap and Snowbird's
potential influence on the visioning process. This depleted its funds
and work is paused until the controversy with land swaps and Mountain
Accord is settled.

# Utah County

Commissioner Bill Lee told of his involvement in this issue, which
started several weeks ago. He expressed his shock and dismay at
hearing about the proposed land swap was planned to occur no input or
representation from Utah County. The county held a hearing on the
issue, and he had conversations with Mountain Accord regarding his
concerns. Mr. Lee reported tonight that Mountain Accord passed a
motion saying they will stop considering the Utah County land swap
until Utah County has a chance to conduct its own study and make a
recommendation. he concluded by saying that more work needs to be done
and more voices need to be heard.

# Questions and Answers

Mr. Lee fielded a number of questions:

*Q*: How important is it to have cities pass resolutions, like American
Fork?

*A*: It would mean a great deal to see support from cities, particularly
on the process.

*Q*: What is the scope of the process that Utah County will use, and who
will be involved?

*A*: Not sure yet, will need to discuss this with the commissioners. Has
heard lots of ideas.

*Q*: Did Mountain Accord request a timeline?

*A*: Initially they wanted 90 days, but they agreed that there would be
no constraints until Utah County goes through the process.

*Q*: The Mountain Accord website says they will give Utah County seats
 at the table, and input, but allowing the process until July 21st.

*A*: Some press releases have said things like this, but there have
 been more conversations affirming the desire for more time. Mountain
 Accord offered money for meetings, help with a task force,
 applications, the governorâ€™s office, and so forth, because they want
 to help. However, Mr. Lee said that because of all that has happened,
 he wanted Utah County to go through its process independently.

At this point, one attendee expressed a desire to have Utah County
land completely out of the MA process, which was met with warm
applause.

*Q*: Where is Snowbird with the land swap?

*A*: It has not been submitted to National Forest yet, because
 Snowbird wants to go through a process and work with groups not just
 do it on their own. There are federal statutes that you have to go
 through, and local government officials need to weigh in. If there is
 resistance, then it is not in your favor to go forward without
 consensus. Snowbird is looking for consensus.

*Q*: Why are there do not trespass signs by Snowbird in Mineral Basin?

*A*: They do own land there, and we need to be sensitive to private
 property rights.

*Q*: If Snowbird is making money off Utah County lands, can we get a
 share of tax revenues?

*A*: Yes, we can get property tax revenues. Sales tax revenue is
 generated at the point of sale, so this is not available. (John
 Dougall confirmed this later.)

*Q*: How can Snowbird swap land in Utah County for land in Salt Lake County?

*A*: The Forest Service can certainly allow this, but we should run it
 through a County process.

*Q*: How can they put in a gondola on Forest Service land?

*A*: They go through a permitting process with public hearings. With
 private land they still have to go through the county with building
 permits, zoning, etc. Zoning is CE-1 zone, and they have to meet those
 requirements.

*Q*: Are donations to a candidate proper? You expect that people who
 make major donations or receive major donations recuse themselves
 from the process.

*A*: John Dougall jumped in and said recusal depends on state law and
office. But disclosure must happen.

*Q*: Under what authority does Mountain Accord operate? What happens
 if the Utah County recommendation is no swap, can they supersede that
 recommendation?

*A*: Mountain Accord has no legal authority. They just make plans and
 recommendations.

*Q*: In the land swap process, are there legal ways to halt the swap once
it has been requested?

*A*: Yes, there are plenty.

*Q*: What are disclosure requirements for city officials?

*A*: In general, they should file in advance, many disclose at time of
 vote. There is some confusion in law. It is definitely required in
 advance of vote.

*Q*: Can the county rezone the area so that it does not allow any
 kind of development and is preserved as a wilderness?

*A*: Yes, this is something the county can look into.

# Mayors

Mayor Watkins from Alpine stated his general support of community
involvement in the process and protecting the current state of American
Fork Canyon.

Mayor Gygi shared his role in the AFC Vision process. At this time,
there were several questions directed to Gary Gygi regarding his
involvement in the process and with Snowbird. He stated that he did go
to a reception using tickets provided by Snowbird and that he had done
a helicopter tour upon first entering office. He was candid about
liking some of what Snowbird has presented, but stated that he sets
his personal concerns aside and represents the residents of our
city. He defended his role in the AFC Vision process as impartial and
confirmed that he first heard about the proposed land swap with
everyone else when it first came to light.

*This was the two hour mark for the meeting, and I had to leave due to
other commitments.*

# Conclusions

It's clear that Mountain Accord has overstepped its bounds by trying
to get Snowbird to swap land in Salt Lake County for land in Utah
County. This would let them protect watershed in the Cottonwood
Canyons area in return for decreased protections in American Fork
Canyon. In addition, this would bring commercial development into a
pristine wilderness area for the first time. They should not have even
considered land in Utah County without involving Utah County officials
and getting public input from county residents.

Moving forward, it is important that any changes to American Fork
Canyon come with extensive public input from Utah County residents.
My personal preference is to retain the wilderness aspect of the
area and to work with local organizations to help protect the land
from overuse and misuse.

It is not clear whether the AFC Vision project will continue. There is
no remaining funding and significant public distrust, due to donations
from Snowbird and a lack of public meetings and minutes.
Commissioner Bill Lee has indicated the county will develop a process,
but it is not clear what that process will look like, who will be
involved, or what the scope will be.

The Protect and Preserve American Fork Canyon group will certainly
continue to be vocal in advocating for continued public use of the
canyon and preserving its undeveloped, non-commercial character. You
