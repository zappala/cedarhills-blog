Today the Cedar Hills city council will be considering a resolution
written by council member Trent Augustus regarding the American
For Canyon. In this post I will explain why I have prepared a substitute
resolution that I believe better protects American Fork Canyon and
provides a vision the entire council can embrace.

# Background

Preserving the American Fork Canyon wilderness area has emerged as a
top priority for our residents in the last month. For background on
this issue, please see my previous blog post on the [American Fork
Canyon
Meeting](http://cedarhillsblog.org/american-fork-canyon-meeting/) I
attended.

Utah County commissioners have been working to ensure Utah County has
a voice in this process, and asked that cities prepare resolutions
supporting this effort.

# Original Draft Resolution

Council member Trent Augustus prepared a [draft
resolution](/images/afcanyon/resolution-draft-trent-augustus.pdf) that is modeled
after the resolution passed by American Fork City, but with some important changes.
I have several significant concerns with this draft resolution:

* The resolution was only provided to the council the day before our
  council meeting, when we have set a policy that all agenda materials
  be available a week before the meeting. I think it sets bad
  precedent that an important resolution is not drafted in an open and
  transparent manner, when we have committed so strongly as a city to
  open and transparent communicatoin.

* The resolution was immediately shared with Protect and Preserve
  American Fork Canyon, before any council input was given. This
  appears to be an attempt to politicize the process, which is born
  out by some of the provisions in the resolution.

* The resolution attempts to strip the mayor of his position on the AFC
  Vision ad hoc steering committee. Since this committee was formed by MAG and
  members were invited to it, the city of Cedar Hills has no power over its
  membership and no power to force the mayor to step down from his position.

* The resolution attempts to change the powers and duties of the mayor by
  giving the council the power to appoint a representative, when committee
  appointments are made by the recommendation of the mayor with the consent
  and approval of the council.

* The resolution halts the ski bus, a popular program in our city that
  takes kids to Snowbird to learn to ski.  This program is well
  attended and provided to our residents at a much lower price than
  other resorts are offering.

In summary, this resolution has been drafted to try to score political points
against the mayor and against Snowbird, instead of focusing on protecting
and preserving the canyon for future generations. I believe that this
kind of divisiveness should not have a place in city politics, and that we
should act with a united voice to help protect the canyon.

Because of these distractions, the draft resolution is lacking several
important items, which I have detailed in my substitute resolution.

# Substitute Draft Resolution

To assist in obtaining our vision with the canyon, I have prepared a
[substitute
resolution](/images/afcanyon/resolution-substitute-daniel-zappala.pdf)
that focuses on protecting and preserving the American Fork Canyon
wilderness.  Our goals with this resolution are to (1) express
opposition to the proposed Snowbird land swap, (2) request that the
city be involved in current and future discussions regarding American
Fork Canyon, (3) request that all related meetings be held as open and
public meetings, and (4) ask that the commissioners use tools at their
disposal to protect public lands.

I have taken the liberty of revising the original resolution to clean
up grammar and references and to provide clear and plain language with
a minimum of rhetoric.

I will be offering this resolution tonight. Please leave comments below.
I appreciate your input.
