A number of people have asked about city ordinances as it relates to
commercial development. In this post, I'll give a brief overview of
[city
code](http://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=577)
in this area. This includes permitted uses, building height, and
authority of the planning commission and city council to impose
conditions on any development.

<!-- PELICAN_END_SUMMARY -->

## SC-1 Zone

Section **10-3-1** establishes the SC-1 Shopping Center Zone. The city
web site has a [map of all the
zones](http://www.cedarhills.org/sites/default/files/zoning-map.pdf).

Article E discusses the SC-1 Zone. **10-4-E-1** states the intent of this zone:

> The SC-1 zone is established to provide an area in which the primary
> use of land is for commercial and service uses to serve the needs of
> the community and surrounding area and is located in the portion of
> the city most appropriately suited for the purpose. It is intended
> that development within the zone shall be characterized by a
> harmonious grouping of commercial stores and shops and essential
> ancillary uses (parking, signs, landscape features) architecturally
> designed and functioning as an integrated unit. Clean, well lighted
> parking lots, readily accessible from adjacent streets, and
> attractive, well maintained shops with significant peripheral and on
> site landscaping will be characteristic of development within this
> zone. It is the specific intent that architectural design and
> character of operation shall, to the maximum extent possible, be
> compatible with that of surrounding residential environment, and
> review, approval and attachment of conditions upon development
> within the zone will be predicated upon the accomplishment of this
> objective. (Ord. 10-11-95A, 10-11-1995)

A couple of important things are embodied in this code, namely that
the primary use of the land is for commercial use, and that the
operation of the commercial property shall be compatible with the
surrounding residential environment. Conditions can be attached to the
approval of development of the zone to ensure these objectives are
met.

In other words, if residents feel that conditions need to be imposed
regarding density, size, or location of buildings within the SC-1
zone, this is within their right to request these conditions from the
planning commission and city council.

**10-4-E-2** gives the permitted uses of this zone, which includes agriculture, planned commercial developments, and public utilities.

## Commercial Development Guidelines

Section **10-6-A** describes planned commercial developments allowed
in SC-1. **10-6-A-2** lists use requirements:

> Conditional Uses: Buildings, structures and uses of land listed as
> conditional may be permitted within a planned commercial development
> project, subject to compliance with applicable requirements of this
> title and those contained within the document "Guidelines For The
> Design And Review Of Planned Commercial Development Projects", and
> after approval has been given by the designated review agency.

The rules governing commercial development are listed in a separate
document known as our [Design
Guidelines](http://www.cedarhills.org/sites/default/files/commercial-development-guidelines.pdf),
which give broad latitude to the planning commission and city council.

In this document, on Page 31, you will see a map that divides the SC-1
into three sub-districts: Neighborhood Retail (the area closest to
4800 West), Mixed use Office/Retail (the area by the roundabout and
bordering homes on 9980 N), and Mixed Use Office (covering the church,
dental offices, and the Charleston).

Interestingly, the area owned by the city is not included in this map,
perhaps because that area was purchased with recreation development
impact fees, and was originally intended as the location for a park or
recreation center.

Page 6 describes these areas in more detail.

## Neighborhood Retail

This is the area fronting 4800 W.

> The Neighborhood Retail designation is intended to accommodate the
> most intense land uses within the Commercial Master Plan. This
> designation is established to promote retail commercial and service
> uses for the convenience of surrounding residential
> neighborhoods. The standards incorporated within this designation
> are intended to promote a combination of retail and service
> facilities that, in character and scale, are necessary to meet the
> day-to-day needs of area residents. Uses typically found within the
> Neighborhood Retail area include: grocery stores, personal service
> establishments such as dry cleaners, bakeries, restaurants and
> specialty shops such as florists and sporting goods operations.

## Mixed-Use Office/Retail

This is the area owned by the Smart Family by the roundabout.

> The Mixed-Use Office/Retail designation is intended to accommodate
> less intense uses than found in the Neighborhood Retail
> designation. The lower intensity may be due to size, scale and
> height of the structure or due to a less-intense land use. Along
> with office uses, limited retail uses including specialty shops,
> dance, fitness and self-defense studios, along with residential uses
> are permitted within this area.

## Mixed-Use Office

This is the area already developed, with the church, dental buildings,
and the Charleston.

> The Mixed-Use Office designation is intended to accommodate the
> least intense land uses and to provide a buffer to existing or
> future single-family residential areas through landscaping,
> setbacks, building heights and land uses. Also, any retail uses in
> this area shall help create a transition from the more intense uses
> in the other areas to the surrounding residential
> neighborhoods. Building heights within this designation are limited
> to those height restrictions found within adjacent residential
> developments. Community services such as libraries, city hall,
> public recreation facilities are permitted.

## Permitted Uses

Page 7 of the Design Guidelines discusses the permitted and
conditional uses of the SC-1 zone, and no uses are automatically
permitted. This means any development in the zone is conditional on
approval of the planning commission and city council. Specifically:

> To receive approval for a conditional use listed in the chart below,
> the burden of proof shall be on the applicant to demonstrate that
> the use is appropriate for the property or parcel under
> consideration. All conditional uses are required to comply with the
> conditions of approval imposed by the Planning Commission and/or
> City Council. Such conditions shall be imposed to mitigate or
> alleviate any expected or foreseeable adverse impacts the proposed
> conditional use may have on adjacent uses or the surrounding
> area. Typically, conditions of approval address issues such as
> noise, lighting, traffic and aesthetics. Even so, the City shall
> impose any and all conditions they find to be necessary to protect
> the integrity and quality of the master planned area or the
> surrounding neighborhoods.

There is broad latitude for the city to require conditions or to deny
development if there are negative impacts on surrounding
neighborhoods.

Page 8 of the Design Guidelines describes the conditional uses. Of
particular interest is "Residential, attached units", which is a
conditional use but with a footnote. In the Office/Retail
sub-district, residential units are allowed when *"ancillary to a
retail or office use"*. Ancillary is specified to mean *"less than 50%
of any given structure"* and *"is permitted only on the second level of
the structures."* Some of the wording is confusing here. I will suggest
the planning commission revise and clarify this.

Note that, also on page 8, the Design Guidelines do allow conditional
use of an "Assisted living, convalescence home". I will suggest that
the planning commission clarify whether the current development
proposal qualifies under this category or as a "Residential, attached
unit".

## Height and Size

Page 16 discusses structure height for the Mixed-Use Office/Retail
Development sub-district.

> One to three story buildings are permitted although two-story
> buildings are encouraged in order to more fully convey the desired
> architectural theme. Buildings within the Office/Retail Development
> may be erected to a maximum height of thirty (30) feet. An
> additional height bonus of one (1) foot per additional two (2) foot
> increase from the required setback may be granted, up to a maximum
> height of fifty (50) feet occupied space, with unoccupied space
> approved by the City Council with a recommendation from the Planning
> Commission. The Planning Commission may increase the required
> setback or require additional architectural elements for buildings
> taller than thirty-five (35) feet, if after due consideration, feel
> it necessary to mitigate any negative impacts that the proposed
> development may have on the residential development. Height is
> measured from average, finished grade to the top of cornice or
> parapet for flat roofs, and the midpoint of rake for sloped roofs.

The intent of the sub-district is to allow two- and three-story
buildings, though the planning commission may allow buildings that are
a maximum of 50 feet tall, with some conditions.

Subsequent sections also say that the building size shall be reviewed
and approved by the city council, subject to placement, aesthetics,
noise control, lighting design, traffic control, etc. to "give the
feel consistent with the overall commercial development, as well as
the community as a whole."

## Additional Latitude

Additional parts of city code give the city wide latitude in placing
conditions on commercial development. Section **10-6-11** states that

> The planning commission may increase standards where it is
> determined that such increased standards are necessary in order to
> ensure that the development will mesh harmoniously with adjoining or
> nearby uses of property and are necessary to carry out the intent of
> this title.

Section **10-6-11** states

> As a means of harmonizing development within the project with
> existing and planned development within the surrounding area, the
> planning commission may, as a condition of its approval, specify or
> require changes in the minimum and maximum height of buildings and
> structures, the type and style of architecture, the character and
> nature of landscaping, the choice of building and plant materials,
> the pattern of circulation, the location and siting of buildings,
> fences, walls, utilities, lighting and sprinkling facilities and
> other structures, as well as the nature and extent of drainage
> facilities.

Both of these are part of **10-6** discussing Large Scale Development,
which includes planned commercial developments and the design
guidelines discussed above.

## Conclusions

Upon examining city code and the design guidelines, I do not think the
current development, as proposed, fits our design guidelines. The
guidelines state in numerous places that the development must be in
harmony with the surrounding community and should not have negative
impacts to residents. A large, four-or-five story apartment complex
will have significant impacts in terms of size, density, traffic and
parking that are are not a good match for the neighborhood. In
addition, the guidelines seem to indicate a preference that
residential development near the roundabout is restricted to the
second floor and a maximum of 50% of each structure. An exception is
made for an assisted living home, but it is not clear to me whether
the proposal falls under that category.

Some have questioned whether the city may legally make restrictions on
the development. It is clear that the planning commission and city
council have a wide latitude to impose numerous restrictions on
development in the commercial zone to ensure that surrounding
neighborhoods are not adversely affected. While I support commercial
development in our city, I think this particular proposal needs to be
re-worked. I support having a mix of restaurants and retail spaces,
but the residential development has to be in harmony with our
guidelines and the nearby neighborhoods.
