This year the city appointed a Water Conservation Committee to advise
the city on how best to reduce the amount of pressurized irrigation
water residents are using. Conservation is needed if we hope to keep
usage within the design limits our irrigation system and to provide
enough redundancy in case a component of the system
fails. Conservation will also be needed if the area experiences
extended drought. In this post, I will share the recommendations of
the citizens committee.

<!-- PELICAN_END_SUMMARY -->

In 2013 and previous years, the city used far more water than is
needed to keep our lawns healthy. For details on why this is a problem
and the negative effects for our system, see my [previous post on our
pressurized irrigation system](/pressurized-irrigation-capacity/).

## Committee Formation

On [7 January 2014](http://www.cedarhills.org/node/2603), the city
adopted a resolution approving creation of a Water Conservation
Citizens Advisory Committee. On [4 February
2014](http://www.cedarhills.org/node/2658) the following members were
recommended by Mayor Gygi and approved by the city council:

* Richard Noble, Chair
* Joel Wright
* Brady Daley
* Pricilla Leak
* Cliff Chandler
* Betty Jo McKinlay

Then on [4 March 2014](http://www.cedarhills.org/node/2719) three
more members were appointed:

* Paul Blaine Clyde
* Randy Gehring
* Jon Traveller

## Committee Recommendations

The committee met several times, and individual members conducted
research on conservation. The committee made the following
recommendations on [15 April
2014](http://www.cedarhills.org/node/2799), copied verbatim:

### Water Conservation Goal

The committee recommends that the City establish a water conservation
goal. The recommended initial goal is that the P.I System water
consumption be reduced to 50 percent of 2013 levels. This would be a
very significant amount of conservation that could be achieved without
altering the look or feel of our community.

### Metering (Implement prior to 2015 irrigation season)

* The city is unlikely to achieve significant water conservation
  without metering
* Meters should be installed at all P.I. System connections
* Meters should be installed at all City-owned facilities such as golf
  course, parks, parkways, and trails

### Education (begin implementation in 2014)

* Education is needed whether meters are installed or not
* People need an incentive to become educated
* City could provide a credit on utility bills for residents receiving
  water audits
* Encourage residents to take advantage of the rebated program offered
  by Central Utah Water Conservancy District
* City could develop a notification process (telephone or email) when P.I.
  System usage exceeds recommended seasonal usage
* City needs to provide a weekly watering guide indicating how much 
  irrigation water should be applied
* During the irrigation season the City newsletter should provide water
  conservation tips
* Have a Water Conservation Yard of the Month program similar to the City's
  regular Yard of the Month program
* Send out a letter separately from the City utility bill and newsletter
  explaining the problems with the P.I. System and the need for water
  conservation
* Post signs at strategic locations throughout the city showing current
  water usage vs. goal
* If meters are installed, water usage on utility bills could be compared
  to water efficient neighbors similar to Rocky Mountain Power program
* Provide an education program in elementary schools on water
  conservation and encourage children to discuss it with parents
* Educate residents that metering is coming and we need to learn to use
  less now to avoid large financial impacts
* Workshops could be conducted by volunteers on irrigation system maintenance
* City could install trial/demo meters at selected homes throughout the
  City and results could be made available

### Water Rates

The committee recommends that the City implement an ascending block rate
structure for P.I. water usage. The rates should take into account lot size
and seasonal irrigation requirements. The City could provide a very attractive
rate for residents who use less than the recommended amount, a moderate rate
for those who use close to the recommended amount, and then progressively
higher rates for those who waste water.

## Conclusion

The city is actively pursuing these recommendations. See the [Water
Conservation](http://www.cedarhills.org/utilities/water-conservation)
page for details, along with [the city's progress toward our
conservation
goals](http://www.cedarhills.org/utilities/water-conservation/water-ometers).
