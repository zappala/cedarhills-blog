I have heard from a number of residents who are having difficulty
choosing who to vote for in the upcoming city council election. We
have a large field, and it is difficult to know where everyone
stands. To help better understand each candidate, I have
drafted the following questions. Below are the questions and their
answers, along with links to their blogs.

If you are a candidate who would like your answers posted here, please
let me know and I will be happy to add them.

Answers are listed in the order given on the ballot, which is
randomized by the state.

## Question 1

***
*What do you hope to accomplish as a city council member?*
***

**Brian Miller**: I would like to protect and strengthen the qualities
  of Cedar Hills that lead our residents to make the decision to live
  here. We live in a safe, family-oriented community with a small town
  feel. I would also like to increase trust between the residents and
  the city through honesty and transparency. The city has been heading
  in a positive direction recently and I want to ensure that
  trend. Furthermore, I want to make sure that our residents are
  heard. We have a small vocal group but there are many that don’t
  feel they have time for local politics or don’t have an interest
  because they don’t know how the issues affect them. We need to
  involve their voice.

**Angela Johnson**: A top priority would be to help increase resident
  involvement in discussing issues. It is difficult for residents to
  attend meetings so we need to reach out in different ways to gain
  their insight.

**Jenney Rees**: I would continue working to improve communication and
  transparency and would like to see the city utilize technology to
  get information to residents. I would also encourage more resident
  involvement with issues we face as a community. I have enjoyed
  working with resident-driven committees and feel they are a great
  resource as we make decisions on city issues.

**Chris Fowler**: I have no agenda and I love where I live.  In terms
of accomplishment I hope to lend a stronger voice for young families.
Cedar Hills is a young city: 11.6% of our population is under 5, 45.1%
of our population is under 18. I have 4 boys under the age of 8.  I
want to be a stronger voice for the majority of our residents.

## Question 2

***
*How have you already been volunteering or serving in the city?*
***

**Brian Miller**: Yes. Shortly after moving to Cedar Hills, I looked
  for an opportunity to serve our city. I serve on the city’s General
  Plan Advisory Committee. We have been charged with the duty of
  providing specific input to be used to update our city’s general
  plan, which is extremely outdated. This has afforded me the
  opportunity to meet and work with some of our city’s staff, elected
  officials and other residents with a strong desire to serve our
  city. Before moving to Cedar Hills, I served in Pleasant Grove as a
  precinct chair and state delegate.

**Angela Johnson**: I have enjoyed serving as a precinct chair for a
  few years, serving as the volunteer coordinator for the family
  festival, been on the emergency preparedness committee and attending
  or listening to meetings and giving feedback regarding city issues
  for a few years.

**Jenney Rees**: I have been serving on the City Council since
  2012. During that time I have served with the Planning Commission,
  Family Festival Committee, Parks & Trails Committee, Finance
  Committee, and the Cultural Arts Committee. During Family Festival I
  volunteer at most of the events.

**Chris Fowler**: I have coached Cedar Hills tot soccer for 4 years.
  I am a watch dog at Cedar Ridge Elementary.  I have also had the
  opportunity to be a Scout Master for nearly 4 years.

## Question 3

***
*Over the past years, development of a congregate care (senior living)
 facility with 300 units has been proposed and is currently pending
 with the planning commission. What is your opinion on this proposed
 development?*
***

**Brian Miller**: I believe that the current proposal does not conform
  to the general plan and design guideline requirements. Adjustments
  should be made prior to presentation to the planning commission
  and/or city council. The development should fit within what our city
  permits and restricts.  I do support property rights and recognize
  that once a proposal conforms to the city restrictions and
  requirements, the city cannot prevent the sale and development of
  the property at issue, whether residents are in favor or not. I do
  believe resident concerns should be voiced and heard.  Personally, I
  would prefer to see viable retail options that would be supported by
  surrounding residents in place of the senior living facility. Our
  commercial area should be promoted by the city and incentives should
  be offered to secure business that would benefit our community.

**Angela Johnson**: I do not support high density housing in the
  commercial zone. It does not meet the general guidelines and
  ordinances regarding density, helping balance our city's tax base or
  providing retail development.

**Jenney Rees**: I believe that the City Council should hold the
  developer to the intent of our General Plan, zoning laws, and Design
  Guidelines. While some parts may be ambiguous, I believe that
  overall they are very clear as to what type of development was
  intended when that area was zoned as part of our commercial
  area. There are several areas where I feel the current proposal does
  not meet our city ordinances and have outlined that on this blog,
  which can be found here.

**Chris Fowler**: Some commercially zoned areas are on private
  property.  If they have a developer that conforms to city codes.  We
  have to respect those rights. The big issue that Cedar Hills is
  facing is the proposed development of 55+ high density housing on
  the field south of Walmart.  While it is on private property the
  developers proposal does not quite fit the city plans. Residents
  that would be most affected have largely spoken against this
  development. High density housing by its very name seems intense
  when it is clear in the city codes and plans that much of the land
  was planned for less intense.  This is why I am not for the current
  proposal.

## Question 4

***

*Recently, several alternative options for the future of the golf
 course have been discussed. What is your position on these options
 and the discussion?*

***

**Brian Miller**: None of the options that have been discussed make
  financial sense for the city. Our course adds so much unquantifiable
  value to this city. It performs better than the majority of
  municipal golf courses in Utah. The management and staff are
  excellent. Options have been explored previously and nothing being
  proposed is new. Our course has outperformed recent projections.
  While I am always open to listening and considering alternatives, I
  believe that spending a lot time and resources toward exploring
  alternatives that have previously been discussed would be better
  invested in other areas of the city. We need to continue to support
  the course and appreciate the value and benefit it provides to our
  city, for golfers and non-golfers alike.

**Angela Johnson**: I am interested to hear the options discussed by
  the golf course committee. I don't support getting rid of the golf
  course unless there is an option that saves substantial tax dollars
  and allows residents to vote on any new proposal.

**Jenney Rees**: First, I think it is important to note that the data
  which has recently been provided on Facebook is the perspective of
  one person and doesn’t give the complete picture. While I agree that
  it is good for the city to explore options on anything that impacts
  the city, I think that the data that is presented should be complete
  and accurate. I am pleased to see the Golf Course Finance Committee
  working on this as I have seen that our resident-driven committees
  consistently do a great job analyzing data and making
  recommendations based on what is best for the city. I believe the
  option presented of turning the golf course into parks is not
  feasible. It ignores that fact that we still have a bond to pay,
  that it would cost a considerable amount of money to convert the
  course into usable park space, and it opens the city to lawsuits for
  not adhering to agreements it entered in to. The lawsuits alone
  could take years to settle before any of the land could be sold or
  developed, and at a tremendous cost to the city. I’m sure the Golf
  Course Committee will look at these issues and many others as they
  do a complete analysis.

**Chris Fowler**: I have gone through the proposed alternatives.  I am
  appreciative of this diversity of opinion.  I have not seen one that
  makes sense for Cedar Hills.  Many are complex in nature and my
  experience in business tells me that the more complex the
  alternative is, the more risk it incurs. I firmly believe the best
  option is to embrace what we have and make it the best golf course
  in Utah County…it certainly has the potential to be!

## Question 5

***

*The city's general plan and design guidelines need to be updated
 regarding zoning in the commercial area. What would you suggest?*

***

**Brian Miller**: I currently serve on the General Plan Advisory
  Committee. Generally speaking, the values that were put in place in
  the original general plan are still held by Cedar Hills residents
  today. There are many elements that need to be updated regarding the
  growth of the city, commercial development and zoning. Additionally,
  while the plan is by its very name “general,” there are certain
  elements that are currently vague and ambiguous. This puts the
  planning commission and the city council in a precarious position at
  times without specific guidance. These vague and ambiguous terms
  should be specific and directive.

**Angela Johnson**: I feel the guidelines need and zoning need to
  clearly state what is allowed. There are many vague statements that
  need to be updated.

**Jenney Rees**: The process that is currently in progress is a good
  start. A resident-driven committee was formed (General Plan
  Committee) to review the current General Plan, solicit feedback from
  residents, and make a recommendation to the Council. The Planning
  Commission is in the process of reviewing the Design Guidelines to
  make recommendations for changes. I believe the intent of our
  General Plan already reflects the desires of the community when it
  states “This zone [SC-1] provides for commercial and retail uses
  within the community...The zone allows the community to better balance
  the tax base, and provides residents with employment opportunities,
  retail goods, and office space...Cedar Hills will encourage
  commercial development which will directly benefit the residents of
  the community.” I believe our Design Guidelines could be more
  specific to remove any ambiguity. I appreciate that both the General
  Plan Committee and the Planning Commission are soliciting feedback
  from residents throughout this process.

**Chris Fowler**: We do need to take a detailed look.  Have we lost
  business development options because of this?  It is certainly time
  to revisit this with major input coming from residents.

## Question 6

***

*Recently the council has had a discussion on making the recreation
 center more of a community center that residents can use
 regularly. Currently the city has been using the Vista Room as a
 revenue source, bringing in approximately $80,000 in revenue this
 year, above expenses. Would you prefer to have more community or
 resident events in this space, even if this meant less revenue for
 the city? How would you use the basement areas? What ideas do you
 have for making the community center a better resource for our
 community?*

***

**Brian Miller**: I think that we should continue maximizing revenue
  for the great asset that is the Vista Room. What a gem! I believe
  that days that go unbooked after a certain deadline may be offered
  for a deeper discount for resident activities. More activities put
  on by the city should be held there for little or no cost to the
  residents so that everyone feels that it is “theirs.” These could be
  holiday or theme related events for families. A date night put on by
  the city would be neat as well, with dinner and dancing, for a
  reasonable fee.  The basement is sterile and unattractive. The lack
  of decorations on the walls creates an echo. It serves well as a
  meeting space and should be available only for a cleaning
  fee. Scheduled community activities could take place there with
  classes for kids and adults, a babysitting night to allow parents to
  go out, scouting events, etc.

**Angela Johnson**: We need to continue to bring in revenue at the
  community center. If there are days that it isn't being utilized,
  residents could be allowed to use the community center at a
  discounted rate possibly.

**Jenney Rees**: I would prefer to have more community and/or resident
  events in this space. The building was paid for with recreation
  impact fees that were collected to build a recreation facility. We
  should honor that and have recreation and/or community events often,
  and allow residents to utilize the building at reasonable rates. I
  also understand that the intent of those who approved the current
  building was to bring in revenue to offset some of the golf course
  losses. I think we can find a middle ground. During the last Council
  meeting I suggested that we not book any receptions on Monday and
  Tuesday nights and leave these open for residents to use at a highly
  discounted rate (I’m thinking $10/hour). Our residents pay for this
  building with property taxes and it should be a building that is
  open for residents to use. We could continue to have paid bookings
  for Wednesday-Saturday nights, which is when most events are
  currently scheduled, and the revenues do help offset golf course
  losses. I would also like to see a minimum of four community events
  held each year. We already have the Santa night and the summer
  breakfast, I would like to see at least two more each year that are
  sponsored by the city. I would also like to see the basement
  utilized for more youth activities, whether that be additional
  classes, merit badge classes, game nights, etc. I would like to hear
  from residents on what types of events they feel could be held there
  that would be successful. We’ve tried some adult classes (gardening,
  IFA), but nobody showed up so I feel youth activities would be
  better attended. I am fine adjusting our revenue budget for events
  to accommodate more community or resident use of the building.

**Chris Fowler**: We should embrace the Vista room as the premier
  place for weddings.  My brother-in-law got married there.  It is a
  great source of revenue and brings people into our beautiful city.
  I certainly think we can do a better job in making use of the
  community center.  I am an idea guy.  I love coming up with ways we
  can maximize our resources.  Two ideas I have would be: (1) Create
  year round programs tied to the most popular youth recreation
  program (soccer, baseball, etc) These programs could include things
  like arts and crafts, karate, computers, golf lessons, etc.  I
  believe parents would love the idea at having a 1 time a year
  registration that puts their kids in year round activities. (2)
  Instead of thinking city wide activities we should look at
  neighborhood wide activities.  If we designed activities specific to
  a certain neighborhood, turn out would be better, involvement would
  be better.  Activities could include ice cream socials, bingo
  nights, bunko book clubs, emergency preparedness classes, youth
  activities, etc.

## Question 7

***

*The grill at the community center has struggled to be a viable
 business, with several outside vendors not succeeding. The city has
 issued an RFP for a new vendor, recently, to try again. The city has
 tried running the grill itself, but lost money as well. Do you have
 suggestions for using this space more effectively?*

***

**Brian Miller**: This is a difficult situation with no clear
  answer. It baffles me that a grill at a well-attended golf course
  does not succeed. I believe that if a new vendor runs a grill, it
  should be promoted to the community as a restaurant, unassociated
  with the golf course. A destination for local families. I am not
  sure that is how they have been presented in the past. But for Cedar
  Hills, a community of large families and fiscally minded people, it
  would certainly have to be a good value; reasonable cost for good
  food. Grill hours should be reduced to peak hours only, on the
  busiest days, and rent may need to be reduced. I am also open to
  converting space to a general community space; art center, library
  space, etc.

**Angela Johnson**: I think discussing what could go where the grill
  was would be a great discussion for residents. With an approximately
  $1400/month cost to any business, it doesn't appear a restaurant
  could succeed in that location.

**Jenney Rees**: We’ve tried running a grill for three years and it
  has not worked. I think the message being received is this is not an
  amenity people will use. It may be the location, lack of
  advertising, menu, or a combination of many things, but I feel it’s
  time to recognize that it will always struggle as a grill. I would
  like to look at other options for that space. CM Zappala made a
  suggestion at Council meeting that we look at changing it into a
  community spot where residents can utilize it at any time. Something
  like a volunteer library or gathering spot. If this isn’t feasible
  and we need to keep it as a grill, I think it makes sense to reduce
  the hours to only be open when the majority of the customers were
  coming in. It doesn’t make sense to have a grill open for 12 hours a
  day if it is empty many of those hours.

**Chris Fowler**: This is a challenging situation.  I would study the
  numbers compare to other restaurants in the area/similar situation
  and go from there.  Ideas include a small drink and snack shop (food
  preparation minimal) to a more formal sit down restaurant that we
  can all be proud of.  At the end of the day the city needs to look
  at all options including lowering cost for the space, revenue
  sharing, etc.

## Question 8

***

*The city has struggled with overuse of pressurized irrigation
 water. As a result we are now using our backup water supply for
 irrigation during busy months, meaning we no longer have an adequate
 backup for irrigation water should a component fail. During summer
 months, we are pumping water into the PI system at its maximum
 capacity, which causes wear and tear on the components leading to a
 higher probability of component failure. Basically, our system was
 never designed to carry the volume of water residents are using,
 which is twice the rate it was designed for resulting in our system
 not having the capacity. Some have suggested voluntary water
 restrictions are the right solution to this problem, others have said
 we need metering to ensure everyone pays for what they use, like
 other utilities. What would be your recommendation to move forward on
 this issue?*

***

**Brian Miller**: I believe that we should stay the course with
  community education and encouragement (less use, less lawns, more
  responsible watering practices, etc). Let’s wait and see what
  happens with the state in regards to metering. I do not support the
  city spending any additional funds on this issue at this time.

**Angela Johnson**: I do not support implementing a $2 million water
  metering system. The state may well mandate this at some point but
  would likely pay for part if not all. We need to not only encourage
  every other day usage but recommend an amount of time and keep
  promoting conservation.

**Jenney Rees**: This is an issue the entire state is facing, not just
  our city. I believe that the State will mandate PI metering at some
  point. They are already having discussions on this topic and
  acknowledged that they would have an obligation to help fund it if
  it was mandated. I agree with the concerns expressed, and I worry
  about the amount of culinary water we push in to our PI system each
  year. We tried an aggressive education campaign last year and
  watering restrictions this year. I look forward to seeing the
  numbers at the end of the season to see if either has had much of an
  impact on water usage. I do believe we should hold off installing
  meters on our own until we see what direction the State is going. It
  doesn’t make sense for us to shoulder all of the financial burden if
  we can receive help from the State.

**Chris Fowler**: I think this is a larger problem then just Cedar
  Hills.  It is a Utah problem.  I think that there first needs to be
  continued education on water conservation, applied effort to
  voluntarily restrict water use, etc. Metering would be very
  expensive to put in.  It also may be required at some future point
  by the state (which would mean state funding) I think at this time
  we continue our current efforts.  Metering will ultimately be the
  solution but let’s wait to see where the state goes.

## Question 9

***

* If you are not elected, what would you do to try to help work on
 ideas or issues that are important to you?*

***

**Brian Miller**: I will continue to serve on the General Plan
  Advisory Committee, participate in city dialogue and attend city
  council meetings.

**Angela Johnson**: I will always be involved in following issues. I
  love cedar hills and have a true desire to help our community be as
  successful as possible.

**Jenney Rees**: I would continue to stay in touch with my elected
  officials and share my thoughts or concerns in a constructive
  manner. I have already told one resident-driven committee chair that
  I would like to become a permanent volunteer on that committee if I
  am not re-elected. I have enjoyed working with other volunteers in
  our city and am impressed with what is accomplished through those
  efforts. While I hope I can continue serving on the Council, I will
  continue serving as a volunteer if I’m not re-elected.

**Chris Fowler**: Running for City Council has sure been like jumping
  into a mountain lake.  It is uncomfortable but exhilarating.  I will
  continue to be involved with Cedar Hills sports teams, be part of
  this great community and be a connection between city government and
  residents.

## Question 10

***

*If you are elected, how will you solicit input from areas of the city
 outside of where you live?*

***

**Brian Miller**: Aside from continued participation on social media,
  I believe having regular neighborhood cottage meetings would be
  productive. These would be social meet-and-greet meetings held in
  specific neighborhoods. A small budget or donations could be used to
  make it a fun atmosphere with food, refreshments, balloons,
  etc. Let’s bring the elected councilmembers TO the
  community. Regular no/low cost surveys can also be valuable.

**Angela Johnson**: I would like to see us solicit input with a city
  wide Facebook page and through other social media. I would also
  encourage the use of inexpensive surveys that are statistically
  correct on important issues.

**Jenney Rees**: I have worked to stay engaged with residents
  throughout the community through my blog, social media, the About
  Cedar Hills forum, email, phone, and face-to-face meetings. I would
  continue with these avenues as I’ve found them effective.

**Chris Fowler**: I would continue to use technology as a platform to
  communicate and seek feedback.  I would also not be afraid to pick
  up the phone and make calls to residents (we do a good job getting
  candidates names out there during campaign season, I don’t see why
  it would be impossible to get the issues out there as well)

## Question 11

***

*When the council is faced with a decision, it often wants resident
feedback. Some have suggested we could poll residents on every major
issue, but others worry this could be tiring for residents (leading to
low response rates) and would rather trust those who represent them to
study the issue and make a good decision. How would you handle these
concerns?*

***

**Brian Miller**: As a councilmember, you are elected to a position of
  trust. Simply put, I believe that large issues that do not have a
  consensus among residents should be presented for input or put out
  in a survey. Residents expect the council to use its judgment on
  smaller, less impactful issues. This judgment should be based on
  facts, analysis, rationale and sound reason.

**Angela Johnson**: There will be times to do statistically correct
  surveys that will hopefully provide in depth information as to the
  pros and cons of the issue.  I think there is ample opportunity to
  reach out to residents through social media and see how they are
  feeling about issues, also.  Certainly not everything needs a vote
  or a survey but it is great to get resident input in other ways as
  often as possible.

**Jenney Rees**: I think it needs to be a combination of both. The
  city hires a firm to do a rather large survey every other year, and
  this has always provided very good feedback as we discuss the
  long-term goals of the city. I would like to do an online survey
  each January as the Council puts together the goals for that year so
  that we know that they align with what residents want. I think
  staying in touch with residents through a variety of channels helps
  elected officials know the will of the residents. But I also feel
  that residents elect officials to do the research, attend the
  meetings, meet with staff and residents, receive legal counsel,
  etc. and make decisions based on findings from these efforts. We are
  elected to do the work and should be doing it, not passing the buck
  by putting out a sentence or two in a survey and expecting the
  decisions to be made for us.

**Chris Fowler**: I would pick up the phone and call people and ask
  them.  That’s what you do in business if you want something done.
  Also technology has changed the game, can we create an app that
  facilitates resident feedback?  It also can keep people informed of
  city events, decisions, emergency preparedness, activities, etc.

## Question 12

***

*When you hear about something that concerns you in the city, what
steps would you take to see that this concern is resolved?*

***

**Brian Miller**: I would first try to figure out what the actual
  issue is (not the perceived issue), and what is the basis or
  motivation behind it. I would then research all I can to find actual
  facts for clarity. If it is a day-to-day or a functional problem, I
  would call the city staff to speak with the appropriate person. If
  it is policy related, then I would speak with a city council member,
  giving an explanation that includes specific facts, examples,
  proposed resolutions, and a request for action.

**Angela Johnson**: If I hear of a concern, I would hope we could
  discuss it during work sessions.  We can then assess if there is
  something that needs to be done moving forward.

**Jenney Rees**: I’m a big believer in following through. When issues
  have come to my attention, I work with other officials and/or staff
  to see what resolutions can be found and then make sure that the
  information is being communicated back to those who had the
  concern. While it will never be possible to make a decision that
  everyone in the city agrees with, I think most appreciate receiving
  communication about how their concerns were discussed and addressed,
  even if the outcome wasn’t the one they were hoping for. Residents
  should expect elected officials to research their concerns and
  report back in detail.

**Chris Fowler**: (1) Seek to understand the issue, (2) Communicate
  the issue to City Council members, (3) Follow up on possible
  solutions, (4) Work to implement solution, (5) Express gratitude for
  those who helped.
