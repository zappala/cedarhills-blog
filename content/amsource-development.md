On Tuesday, 6 May 2014, Amsource submitted preliminary plans to the
City Council for approval. This property is located at the southeast
corner of Cedar Hills Drive and North County Blvd., directly across
from Chase Bank. The proposal includes the construction of an America
First Credit Union and two retail pads. Amsource is hoping to break
ground as soon as possible and would like to have the retail pads open
for the coming holiday season.
 
<!-- PELICAN_END_SUMMARY -->

## Site Plan

The site plan provided by Amsource shows the America First Credit
Union (AFCU) on the corner, across from Chase Bank, with two retail
pads called Building A and Building B to the west.

On the south, the road between the AFCU and Harts will be lengthened
and widened, to provide access to the credit union and retail area.
On the north, there will be a right-in/right-out access off Cedar
Hills Drive. The existing median will prevent a left turn into the
development from Cedar Hills Drive, since the turn is too close to the
intersection.

Pedestrian access to the AFCU will use a crosswalk at the northwest
corner and on the south side of the building. I have asked Amsource to
raise the northwest crosswalk into a speed table, and they agreed to
make this change. The retail pads have good pedestrian access from
both Cedar Hills Drive and the future road to the east.

## Future Public Road

The main topic of discussion at the city council meeting was the
construction of the road labeled Future Public Road to the east of the
development. This road is mostly on the Smart property, with a small
portion on the Amsource property.

Chief Freeman, from Lone Peak Fire, would prefer that this road is
built as part of the development. This would enable emergency vehicles
quick access to the retail stores. However, Amsource does not have the
ability to create this road on its own, since it is on the Smart
property, and the proposed development on the Smart property is likely
not moving forward at this time. Chief Freeman stated this would
result in 30 seconds of extra time to make a series of three left
turns, to access the area via the road between the AFCU and Harts.
The council left open the possibility of a temporary road until
development of the Smart property.

## Landscape Plan

Our [Commercial Development
Guidelines](http://www.cedarhills.org/sites/default/files/commercial-development-guidelines.pdf)
require 30% of the development to be landscaped, with plans approved
by the planning commission and city council.

![landscape plan](/images/amsource/landscape-plan.png)
<span class="caption">![pdf](/theme/images/pdficon_small.png) [site plan](/images/amsource/landscape-plan.pdf)</span>

The landscape plan presented by Amsource includes a variety of trees,
including flowering pear, maple, flowering cherry, spruce, and
honeylocust. Numerous shrubs include dogwood, barberry, boxwood,
laurel, spirea, and juniper, as well as ornamental grasses.

I recommended to Amsource that they provided additional trees on the
south of Building B so that 10040 North is treelined down its
length. I also recommended additional trees on the east of buildings A
and B so that the Future Public Road is treelined.

## AFCU Rendering and Elevations

![AFCU rendering](/images/amsource/afcu-rendering.jpg)

The rendering of the AFCU shows some colonial elements, such as the
columns along the entryway and a brick facade. It's a little bit
difficult to match up this rendering with the site plan, but I believe
this is a view from the north side of the building. 

The architecture of the building should follow the colonial style more
closely. Our [Design
Guidelines](http://www.cedarhills.org/sites/default/files/commercial-development-guidelines.pdf) say:

> The particular theme that has been selected for this project is
> American Colonial. The American Colonial motif is a symmetrical
> design (ABA, ABCBA, etc.) style. High-pitched tile or slate roofs,
> either side gabled or hipped, overhang the front facade and are
> often capped with a cupola. A central door, often a French door, is
> sided by large windows on the sides. Buildings may use the classic
> temple front, or contain pillars, pilasters and the Palladian
> window. Exterior construction is normally of brick in traditional
> colors like red and brown, and makes use of substantial exterior
> moldings. Wrought iron or copper accents are also used.

I would like to see the incorporation of design elements from other
buildings in our commercial area, such as parapets and dormers on the
roof, white trim on windows, and stronger use of white columns. I
would also like the entrance of the building follow the design of a
central, French door, with large windows, similar to Chase.

The elevations show the height of the building and some of the materials:

## Retail Elevations

The retail building A and B elevations show the elevations and materials
for the pads:

![retail A elevations](/images/amsource/retail-a-elevations.png)
<span class="caption">![pdf](/theme/images/pdficon_small.png) [retail A elevations](/images/amsource/retail-a-elevations.pdf)</span>

![retail B elevations](/images/amsource/retail-b-elevations.png)
<span class="caption">![pdf](/theme/images/pdficon_small.png) [retail b elevations](/images/amsource/retail-b-elevations.pdf)</span>

As with the AFCU building, improvements are needed to maintain a
colonial style, including pitched roofs, potentially dormers, white
pillars, Palladian windows, etc.

## Lighting Plan

City code requires a lighting plan and design guidelines specify the
following:

> * Lighting plans shall be prepared for each individual site. Adequate lighting shall be provided to encourage pedestrian activity and to eliminate shadowed areas that may contribute to poor visibility and the creation of dark areas.
> * Wall mounted lighting shall not be located higher than 20 feet on any structure.
> * Pole mounted lighting along 4800 West and Cedar Hills Drive shall not exceed 30 feet in height. Pole mounted lighting for the interior of the commercial development shall not exceed 20 feet in height. Pole mounted lighting within any residential areas shall not exceed 15 feet in height.
> * Dark-sky lighting fixtures shall be used in all areas of this development. Shields, covers, or other mechanisms shall be incorporated into fixture design so as to prevent light pollution.
> * Cobra-head and shoe box light fixtures are prohibited.

Amsource has provided ![pdf](/theme/images/pdficon_small.png) [lighting
calculations](/images/amsource/lighting-calculations.pdf), which show
the illuminance in footcandles for each area of the project. A
footcandle is the amount of light you would get within one foot of a
candle.

For parking lots, the Dark Sky Society
![pdf](/theme/images/pdficon_small.png) [recommends](http://www.darkskysociety.org/handouts/LightingPlanGuidelines.pdf)
0.8 fc average with a minimum of 0.2 fc. The lighting calculations
provided by Amsource show an average of 1.8 to 2.1 fc and a minimum of
0.4 to 0.6 fc.

The ![pdf](/theme/images/pdficon_small.png) [lighting
details](/images/amsource/lighting-details.pdf) show the types of
lights to be used, which should be full cut off to prevent light from
shining up into the sky.

## Traffic Study

A traffic study is required for commercial projects, and Amsource
provided a ![pdf](/theme/images/pdficon_small.png) [traffic
study](/images/amsource/traffic-study.pdf) conducted by Falcon
Traffic.  The study looked only at PM peak traffic since the AFCU will be closed during the AM peak. The peak hour used was 5:00 pm.

The study includes maps showing the existing traffic during the PM peak hour:

![existing traffic](/images/amsource/traffic-study-existing.png)

the traffic generated by the site:

![site generated](/images/amsource/traffic-study-peak-site-generated.png)

and the traffic generated by the site added into existing traffic:

![site generated plus existing](/images/amsource/traffic-study-peak-site-generated-plus-existing.png)

The result of the study is showing the level of service at the site,
which is rate on a scale from A to F. The intersection at Harts and
North County Blvd. shows no significant change:

![traffic study harts 4800](/images/amsource/traffic-study-harts-4800.png)

Note there is an existing C rating for a westbound left turn, meaning
turning left from the road at Harts onto North County Blvd.

When the road to the east of the development is put in, it will be
directly across from the main Walmart entrance on Cedar Hills Drive. The
results for this intersection are:

![traffic study walmart cedarhills](/images/amsource/traffic-study-walmart-cedarhills.png)

Note that there is an existing rating of C to turn left out of the
Walmart parking lot, which I suspect is even worse during the school
AM rush hour. With this project, that turn becomes an E rating, which
will cause significant frustration for Cedar Hills residents wishing
to go home after visiting Walmart. Turning left out of the projected
development to proceed west on Cedar Hills Drive will have a rating of
C.

The council should explore whether a signal will be needed at this
intersection when the road is built.

## Other Documents

Other documents Amsource has filed include:

* a ![pdf](/theme/images/pdficon_small.png) [geotechnical
  study](/images/amsource/geotechnical-study.pdf) indicating soil and
  groundwater conditions at the site, so that proper foundations and
  seismic recommendations can be followed;

* a ![pdf](/theme/images/pdficon_small.png) [storm water
  analysis](/images/amsource/storm-water-study.pdf) to ensure that
  underground storage chambers can be used to store water runoff from
  a 100 year storm;

* a ![pdf](/theme/images/pdficon_small.png) [noise
  analysis](/images/amsource/afcu-noise-letter.pdf) that indicates no
  obvious on-site activities that would present noise above background
  traffic from the adjacent streets; and

* a ![pdf](/theme/images/pdficon_small.png) [civil plan
  set](/images/amsource/civil-plan-set.pdf) that includes a demolition
  plan, site plan, grading plan, utility plan, erosion control plan,
  and landscape plan.

## Recommendations

I recommend that Amsource:

* raise the northwest crosswalk into a speed table;

* install additional landscaping on the south of Building B and the
  east of Buildings A and B to ensure all streets are treelined;

* revise the architecture of the buildings so that they better follow
  the colonial style in the design guidelines, including parapets and
  dormers on the roof, white trim on windows, stronger use of white
  columns, and a French door entrance on the credit union;

Staff is also recommending Amsource:

* show the water line between buildings A & B to be stubbed to edge of
  property to eventually be connected to the future public road;

* show finished road, curb and gutter on all of the Amsource property
  (southwest corner shows as being unfinished);

* explore the possibility of a public safety access easement on the
  Smart Property;

* ensure that the access to AFCU is parallel with the access to Harts;

* finalize a development agreement;

* create final plans that will be subject to engineering;

* add utility profiles to submitted plans for engineering review; and

* show conveyance of water rights.

The council voted to grant preliminary approval subject to the first
two conditions in my recommendation list. The council and staff will
be working on these additional recommendations as the project moves
forward.
