What Needs Fixing?

- patchwork road over many years, never design as a highway

- pavement and road base is deteriorating -- mill and pave
  - signs of subgrade failure
  - surface failure
residual service life of 10 or higher, 20 max
- 20 year period and then have to rebuild
- surface traeatment
- RSL of Canyon Road is 5 or less in some places
- if had maintanied roa better, RSL could have been at 10 or higher
 with surface treatments
- will fix some waviness but still not dseigned properly
- better than what we have today

- drainage
  - ponding leads to hydroplaning, ice formation, flooding neighborhood homes
  - need pipes, curb and gutter
- turning lanes
  - currently, anyone turning backs up traffic at a number of intersections
- modify the profile of the road
  - center line crown is not consistent
  - dips and bumps
  - cars bounce
  - cars go off the road
- site distance at some intesections is poor
- shoulder
- pedestrian crossing
- bike lane
- traffic calming for lower speeds

What is Being Done?

- Road has been neglected, UDOT refuses to do anything more than mill and pave.
- Considered a low priority.
- State possibly has an agerement to transfer the road to the county
- County is only willing to do a mill and pave
- Mayor Gygi has worked with MAG to secure approximately $10 million in funding
- This will cover ...

Ownership

- County has asked cities to take ownership of the road if they want anything
done beyond a mill and pave.
- Another negotiating point has been to have the county own the road but
for PG and CH to chip in 60% of the maintenance costs.
- The costs to the city to own the road is estimated at $80K per year for maintenance
- Snow plowing alone will require the city to buy a 10-wheel truck and a wide snow blade, plus build additional covered storage for this equipment
- Any long-term repaving would be footed by the city
